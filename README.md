This is a simple JS bookmarklet that will filter the current page according to
various colour blindnesses.

The colour blind matrices were sourced from an archived page -

They may be inaccurate. Corrections welcome.

To use it, simply put the contents of bookmarklet.min.js into a bookmark or
go to <https://altreus.github.io/colourblind/> to see a demo.

This will only work on browsers that support SVG filters in CSS3 - but you
don't really need to cross-browser test it for colourblindness so you only need
one such browser.

By which I mean, it works in Chrome and Firefox.
